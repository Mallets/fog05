# Introduction

todayâ€™s implementations are tailored to datacentre environments where resources
are fixed, and high bandwidth is available. However, this assumption is not true
for fog and edge environments where heterogeneous resources are geographically
distributed. This makes difficult to support orchestration deployment on low-end
devices as well mobile and distributed in multiple locations.
